Module 2 Challenge for UM Bootcamp

**PROJECT_TITLE:** VBA_STOCK_CHALLENGE

**Project Description:** For this assignment, a script was created to loop through all of the stock information for one year and give an output of:
   - The ticker symbol
   - The yearly change from opening price to closing price throughout one year (per sheet)
   - The percent change from the opening price to the closing price throughout one year (per sheet)
   - The total stock volume of the stock

   - Also creates a summary table with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total stock volume with the ticker symbol and value

   - The script loops through all of the worksheets and displays all of this information for years 2018, 2019 and 2020 on their respective sheets.
